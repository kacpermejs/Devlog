          I had a brief introduction to coding in C# during my 6th semester. The course was titled ".Net and Java
          development platforms".
          We did a few mini-projects there, consisting of: usage of Web API's, Entity Framework and ASP.NET.
          It quickly became my favourite.
          The biggest thing I did with it was my thesis project - a game made with Unity Engine.
          Also used it during my internship where I was making a WPF app.

          It was my first language to learn. The "Programming basics" course based on it.
          Then we moved to C++, to then move back to C to program microcontrollers.
          The most significant thing I did there was a wrapper for VL53L1X sensor.
          The library for this sensor was made for STM32 and I had to rewrite it's I2C communication.

          It was used on most courses.
          On the course of "Algorithm Design and AI" I implemented various data structures and sorting algorithms.
          The course ended with a bigger project - Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI based on MIN-MAX algorithm.
          I made it in C++ and SDL2.
          The next step was "Operating Systems" where we learned about multithreading, mutexes, semaphores and all this
          fun stuff.
          Later we were learning about discrete systems and implemented some scheduling algorithms like flow-shop and
          some more.

          <h3>My thesis project - Design and implementation of a real-time strategy game using the Unity engine</h3>
          <p>
            Official abstract: <br>
            The main goal of this thesis was to design and implement a strategy game, containing
            a system for collecting and processing in-game resources. The game belongs to the
            real-time strategy genre. The implementation includes the use of the A* algorithm to find
            a path in a graph representing the game world. This algorithm is used by artificial
            intelligence units. In the implementation, efforts were made to adhere to the principles of
            the object-oriented programming paradigm and related software design patterns. The final
            result of the work is a game prototype. In the prototype there is a small number of objects
            only for the purpose of testing all the features. The designed system is suitable for easy
            introduction of new environment elements and thus expanding the game contents, without
            the need of interfering with the game code.

          <h3>IOT plant monitoring system</h3>
          This was a university team project. We were constructing a device that will
          measure temperature and humidity around a house plant. The device was sending
          periodical measurements to the database, from which the data was displayed
          inside a mobile app and the user was notified about values outside the certain threshold.
          I was the projects originator and I was responsible for the hardware
          and firmware of the device.

          There isn't much to show by now, but stay put there will be some updates soon.
          All I can say is that it will be a pixelart survival game.
          There will be a full devlog page for this project... soon.
